# GWC-Final-Project
I created this project alongside my peers Anjou, Jaqueline, Katherine and Lauren as our final project during the Girls Who Code summer immersion program.

# Culture Compass
In a world of such diverse cultures and customs, it is often difficult to express our meanings clearly. In the USA, giving a "thumbs up" is a sign of approval. But did you know that giving a "thumbs up" can be considered a rude gesture in Slovakia, China, East Asia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines and many other places?

The goal of Culture Compass is to provide education about cultures across the globe, and thus equip individuals to be more effective communicators.

# How it's Built
We used a JavaScript interactive world map template to create an interactive experience. Onto this foundation, we used HTML and CSS to construct the website.
