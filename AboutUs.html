<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>Our mission is to provide information about different cultures across the world. We strive to become more culturally aware of the different traditions and customs in each culture. Every person in our group has a different background and ethnicity, so our goal is to connect society one click at a time. We hope to unite society with our website, and break the cultural divide that restrict our unity as a race. </p>

<p>Even amongst a small group of five, there lies a multitude of different backgrounds. Although we come from across the globe, we find that within each of our distinctive cultures comes a form of etiquette- a code for formal behavior.</p>

<p>We believe that by stepping into the shoes of those around us - by taking it upon ourselves to learn about others way of living- we become more connected. The effort doesnâ€™t go unnoticed. Rather, the action in itself strengthens a sense of community.</p>

<p>This website was designed for that purpose. We strive to unite society one click at a time. </p>
